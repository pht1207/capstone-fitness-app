        -WorkoutName - Name of the workout
        -DayCompleted - What day it was performed
        -TimeTaken - How much time it took for the workout from start to finish
    Don't worry about having the actual values yet, just get a basis for the HTML set up
    and we'll put the real values in later (That will be done in WorkoutLog.js, more on that later)
